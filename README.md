# Wave Function Collapse Sudoku Solver

Automatic Sudoku solver implemented using the Wave Function Collapse approach.

Because of the way Wave Function Collapse works, it is possible (and quite common) to reach a state where the game is no longer solvable (as you can see in the gif - it is not solved correctly).

This project is a way to see how to implement Wave Function Collapse algorithm, not to solve Sudokus :v
